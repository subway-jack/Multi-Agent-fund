<Task Description>\n## Description\n\nThe 3D bipedal robot is designed to simulate a human. It has a torso (abdomen) with a pair of\nlegs and arms. The legs each consist of three body parts, and the arms 2 body parts (representing the knees and\nelbows respectively). The goal of the environment is to walk forward as fast as possible without falling over.\n\n## Action Space\n\nThe action space is a `Box(-1, 1, (17,), float32)`. An action represents the torques applied at the hinge joints.\n\n| Num | Action                                                                             | Control Min | Control Max | Name (in corresponding XML file) | Joint | Unit         |\n| --- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- | ----------- | -------------------------------- | ----- | ------------ |\n| 0   | Torque applied on the hinge in the y-coordinate of the abdomen                     | -0.4        | 0.4         | abdomen_y                        | hinge | torque (N m) |\n| 1   | Torque applied on the hinge in the z-coordinate of the abdomen                     | -0.4        | 0.4         | abdomen_z                        | hinge | torque (N m) |\n| 2   | Torque applied on the hinge in the x-coordinate of the abdomen                     | -0.4        | 0.4         | abdomen_x                        | hinge | torque (N m) |\n| 3   | Torque applied on the rotor between torso/abdomen and the right hip (x-coordinate) | -0.4        | 0.4         | right_hip_x (right_thigh)        | hinge | torque (N m) |\n| 4   | Torque applied on the rotor between torso/abdomen and the right hip (z-coordinate) | -0.4        | 0.4         | right_hip_z (right_thigh)        | hinge | torque (N m) |\n| 5   | Torque applied on the rotor between torso/abdomen and the right hip (y-coordinate) | -0.4        | 0.4         | right_hip_y (right_thigh)        | hinge | torque (N m) |\n| 6   | Torque applied on the rotor between the right hip/thigh and the right shin         | -0.4        | 0.4         | right_knee                       | hinge | torque (N m) |\n| 7   | Torque applied on the rotor between torso/abdomen and the left hip (x-coordinate)  | -0.4        | 0.4         | left_hip_x (left_thigh)          | hinge | torque (N m) |\n| 8   | Torque applied on the rotor between torso/abdomen and the left hip (z-coordinate)  | -0.4        | 0.4         | left_hip_z (left_thigh)          | hinge | torque (N m) |\n| 9   | Torque applied on the rotor between torso/abdomen and the left hip (y-coordinate)  | -0.4        | 0.4         | left_hip_y (left_thigh)          | hinge | torque (N m) |\n| 10  | Torque applied on the rotor between the left hip/thigh and the left shin           | -0.4        | 0.4         | left_knee                        | hinge | torque (N m) |\n| 11  | Torque applied on the rotor between the torso and right upper arm (coordinate -1)  | -0.4        | 0.4         | right_shoulder1                  | hinge | torque (N m) |\n| 12  | Torque applied on the rotor between the torso and right upper arm (coordinate -2)  | -0.4        | 0.4         | right_shoulder2                  | hinge | torque (N m) |\n| 13  | Torque applied on the rotor between the right upper arm and right lower arm        | -0.4        | 0.4         | right_elbow                      | hinge | torque (N m) |\n| 14  | Torque applied on the rotor between the torso and left upper arm (coordinate -1)   | -0.4        | 0.4         | left_shoulder1                   | hinge | torque (N m) |\n| 15  | Torque applied on the rotor between the torso and left upper arm (coordinate -2)   | -0.4        | 0.4         | left_shoulder2                   | hinge | torque (N m) |\n| 16  | Torque applied on the rotor between the left upper arm and left lower arm          | -0.4        | 0.4         | left_elbow                       | hinge | torque (N m) |\n\n## Observation Space\n\nObservations consist of positional values of different body parts of the Humanoid,\nfollowed by the velocities of those individual parts (their derivatives) with all the\npositions ordered before all the velocities.\n\nBy default, observations do not include the x- and y-coordinates of the torso. These may\nbe included by passing `exclude_current_positions_from_observation=False` during construction.\nIn that case, the observation space will be a `Box(-Inf, Inf, (378,), float64)` where the first two observations\nrepresent the x- and y-coordinates of the torso.\nRegardless of whether `exclude_current_positions_from_observation` was set to true or false, the x- and y-coordinates\nwill be returned in `info` with keys `\"x_position\"` and `\"y_position\"`, respectively.\n\nHowever, by default, the observation is a `Box(-Inf, Inf, (376,), float64)`. The elements correspond to the following:\n\n| Num      | Observation                                                                                                     | Min  | Max | Name (in

One can read more about free joints on the\n[Mujoco Documentation](https://mujoco.readthedocs.io/en/latest/XMLreference.html).\n\n**Note:** Humanoid-v4 environment no longer has the following contact forces issue.\nIf using previous Humanoid versions from v4, there have been reported issues that using a Mujoco-Py version > 2.0\nresults in the contact forces always being 0. As such we recommend to use a Mujoco-Py\nversion < 2.0 when using the Humanoid environment if you would like to report results\nwith contact forces (if contact forces are not used in your experiments, you can use\nversion > 2.0).\n\n## Rewards\n\nThe reward consists of three parts:\n\n- *healthy_reward*: Every timestep that the humanoid is alive (see section Episode Termination for definition), it gets a reward of fixed value `healthy_reward`\n- *forward_reward*: A reward of walking forward which is measured as *`forward_reward_weight` *\n  (average center of mass before action - average center of mass after action)/dt*.\n  *dt* is the time between actions and is dependent on the frame_skip parameter\n  (default is 5), where the frametime is 0.003 - making the default *dt = 5 * 0.003 = 0.015*.\n  This reward would be positive if the humanoid walks forward (in positive x-direction). The calculation\n  for the center of mass is defined in the `.py` file for the Humanoid.\n- *ctrl_cost*: A negative reward for penalising the humanoid if it has too\n  large of a control force. If there are *nu* actuators/controls, then the control has\n  shape  `nu x 1`. It is measured as *`ctrl_cost_weight` * sum(control `<sup>`2 `</sup>`)*.\n- *contact_cost*: A negative reward for penalising the humanoid if the external\n  contact force is too large. It is calculated by clipping\n  *`contact_cost_weight` * sum(external contact force `<sup>`2 `</sup>`)* to the interval specified by `contact_cost_range`.\n\nThe total reward returned is ***reward*** *=* *healthy_reward + forward_reward - ctrl_cost - contact_cost* and `info` will also contain the individual reward terms\n\n## Starting State\n\nAll observations start in state\n(0.0, 0.0,  1.4, 1.0, 0.0  ... 0.0) with a uniform noise in the range\nof [-`reset_noise_scale`, `reset_noise_scale`] added to the positional and velocity values (values in the table)\nfor stochasticity. Note that the initial z coordinate is intentionally\nselected to be high, thereby indicating a standing up humanoid. The initial\norientation is designed to make it face forward as well.\n\n## Episode End\n\nThe humanoid is said to be unhealthy if the z-position of the torso is no longer contained in the\nclosed interval specified by the argument `healthy_z_range`.\n\nIf `terminate_when_unhealthy=True` is passed during construction (which is the default),\nthe episode ends when any of the following happens:\n\n1. Truncation: The episode duration reaches a 1000 timesteps\n2. Termination: The humanoid is unhealthy\n\nIf `terminate_when_unhealthy=False` is passed, the episode is ended only when 1000 timesteps are exceeded.\n\n## Class Definition\n\nThe class should be called \"Environment\". It should have at least:\n\n- an __init__ function to set up the Environment, which defines all the variables described in the above documentation, plus any additional variables needed to maintain the environment state or to implement its functionality.\n- a set_state function to set a custom value for the environment and its internal representation (you can assume that when \"set_state\" is used, the task is not done and internal variables should be set as a consequence). set_state takes a single argument as input: a state observation from the observation space defined above.\n- a step function to predict a step in the environment. The input parameters for the step function are:\n\n  - An action, which must be contained in the action space described above.\n\n  The outputs required by the step function are:\n\n  - An observation, which must be contained in the observation space described above.\n  - The reward for taking the action, as described in the reward definition above.\n  - A boolean variable indicating if the episode is done.\n\n</Task Description>

<Role>
You are a world-class Systems Analyst and Technical Specification Writer, specializing in creating reinforcement learning environments compliant with the Gymnasium API. Your mission is to transform an ambiguous task description into a precise, actionable, and verifiable technical specification.
</Role>

<Environment Name>
{ENVIRONMENT_NAME}
</Environment Name>

<TASK DESCRIPTION>
{task_describe}
</TASK DESCRIPTION>

<Workflow>
Please strictly follow the following six-step process:
1. **Deconstruction and Analysis (Use Version Locking)**
- Identify all ambiguities, gaps, and conflicts in the task description.
- Lock the exact environment version and all key library versions (record name, version, and source link).
- Categorize gaps by type: missing value/unit/range boundary/time-sensitive/ambiguous reference/unclosed list/conflict/no provenance.
2. **Planning and Investigation (Authoritative Search + Evidence Log)**
- For each high/mid-level project, write 1-2 focused queries that include: synonyms/abbreviations, site filters, authoritative domains (e.g., site:numpy.org, site:mujoco.readthedocs.io, site:gymnasium.farama.org, site:doi.org),
and recency windows (e.g., after 2024-01-01 or "last 2 years").
- Execute the query using browser_search and open ≥ 2 trusted results with browser_open.
- If the top source disagrees, open ≥1 additional authoritative sources and triangulate.
- Create an evidence log entry for each opened page: Title | Organization/Author | Version/Submission | URL (+ archived URL)
| Publication Date | Access Date (Asia/Singapore) | 3 Key Facts | Confidence (High/Medium/Low).
3. **Synthesis and Citation (Conflict Resolution)**
- Integrate the findings into a concise evidence summary with citations.
- When sources conflict, explain the differences and justify the chosen resolution (related to version locking).
4. **Refinement and Improvement (Specification Patch)**
- Generate a structured "diff": action/observation space; rewards; termination/truncation; timing (dt/frame_skip); seeding and certainty; numerical tolerances; dependencies; interface flags.
5. **Formalization and Finalization (Ready-to-Use Specification)**
- Write the final specification according to the <Output Format> (OUTPUT_FORMAT>), including the public API, core logic, usage scenarios, and a verification plan aligned with metrics and statistical validation.
6. **Review and Self-Correction (Compliance Check)**
- Verify conformance to the <Output Constraints> (OUTPUT_CONSTRAINTS>), version consistency, SI units, ISO dates, and the inclusion of any code.
</Workflow>

<OUTPUT_CONSTRAINTS>
* Strictly adhere to the structure defined in <PLANNING_STRUCTURE>.
* Do NOT output runnable code definitions (classes, functions). Only may include short illustrative snippets or pseudo-code.
* All claims about industry standards or common practices MUST be supported by citations.
* Use ISO-8601 dates (e.g., 2025-09-02).
* Use SI units for physical and mathematical quantities.
* Data-leakage rule: Do not access, copy, quote, or derive from raw source code in the OpenAI/Gym/Gymnasium repositories or similar code repositories. Do not include any repository code in the output. Prefer official documentation, standards, papers, or reputable secondary sources. If the only available evidence is a code repository, summarize behavior without copying code and mark it as an inference with risks.
</OUTPUT_CONSTRAINTS>

<PLANNING_STRUCTURE>
Your output must begin with this planning and analysis section.
1. **Ambiguity Analysis**
   - List each ambiguity/vagueness/conflict and mark Impact: High / Medium / Low.
   - Cover at least: missing numeric value, missing unit, missing boundary/range, time-sensitive items,
     unclear references, open lists (“etc.”/“e.g.”), conflicts, and missing citation.
2. **Investigation Plan**
   - For each High/Medium item, provide one atomic question.
   - For each question, provide 1–2 executable queries including: synonyms/abbreviations, a site filter to authoritative
     domains, and a time window (e.g., after:2024-01-01 or “past 2 years”).
   - State the minimum evidence policy: High/Medium → ≥2 credible sources; if disagreement → add ≥1 more for triangulation.
</PLANNING_STRUCTURE>

<Formula requirements>
* For any formula, define all symbols, units, and applicability constraints.
* Cite the source of the formula immediately after its definition.
* Provide the complete formula rather than a descriptive explanation.
</Formula requirements>

<OUTPUT_FORMAT>
Please provide the final specification document structured as follows. This is the primary deliverable. Do NOT include code.

<Version & Provenance>
* Environment name and version lock (e.g., vX.Y); document/library versions; commit hash (if applicable).
* Source release date AND Accessed date (ISO-8601, Asia/Singapore).
* Scope note: this specification normalizes any legacy or paper-specific differences.

<Evidence Summary>
* For each ambiguity/issue, summarize findings with references.
* Citation format: [Source Name, YYYY-MM-DD] "Optional ≤20-word quote."
* If sources conflict, describe the conflict and justify the chosen resolution.

<Spec Patch>
* Structured key–value decisions that resolve ambiguities (the “diff”).
* Cover: action/observation spaces; reward function; termination/truncation; timing (dt/frame_skip); seeding; dependencies; numeric tolerances; interface flags.
* Example entries: `reward.penalty.late = -0.5`, `termination.max_steps = 1000`, `obs.dtype = float32`.
</Spec Patch>

<Theoretical Foundations>
* Formal MDP definition and core equations (e.g., discounted return, Bellman optimality).
* Domain formulas (physics/math) with full definitions, units, ranges, and assumptions.
* If shaping is used, specify potential-based shaping formula and cite invariance guarantees.
* Provide a Symbol Table listing every symbol (name, unit, allowable range).

<Final Specification>
* Standalone, unambiguous description integrating the Spec Patch.
* Public API Definition: class name; __init__ parameters; method signatures (reset, step, set_state, etc.) with type hints (no code).
* Core Logic Description: precise `reset`/`step` semantics; state update rules; reward calculation; termination and truncation checks; info fields.
* Usage Scenarios & Examples: at least two multi-step traces. For each step, list:
  - observation, action, reward, terminated (bool), truncated (bool), info (dict)
  - Use SI units and exact values/ranges; no vague terms (“about”, “etc.”).

<Assumptions & Risks>
* Assumptions made due to missing/conflicting evidence; risks and potential impacts.

<Third-Party Library Usage>
* How official documentation informs interfaces, units, and signatures.
* Allowed libraries and reasons (e.g., RNG seeding, vectorized math, simulation).
* Cite specific APIs (e.g., numpy.random.Generator seeding; np.clip semantics; MuJoCo timestep/frame_skip).
* State explicitly: no new runtime dependencies are introduced by this spec and no source code is copied; documentation is used only to clarify behavior.
